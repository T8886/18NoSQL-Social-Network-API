WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize. WHEN I enter schema and seed commands THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data. WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database. WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
